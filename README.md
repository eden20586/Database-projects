Hey, I'm Eden Admoni, and in this repository, I will show some projects in the database topics.


In the projects, we will see the ability to create tables, create relationships between the tables, SQL queries, create forms and diagrams (ERD),build basic GUI in Python and more.


The first project will be in Access software and the second project will be in MySql software.
